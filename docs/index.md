Web-App development framework for Python

## About

**flare** is an app development framework for Python-based web-apps running on top of [Pyodide](https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide) in the browser.

It has integrations to concepts with [ViUR](https://www.viur.dev/), an MVC-framework for the Google App Engine platform, but can also be used stand-alone.
